# Reproducibility_sage
This is a small sage project to show that you can compute (x*y)*z which can be different of x*(y*z)

You can verify the float-point error with : 
`sage fail.sage`

Or you can verify the fix by adding an overflow possible on precision space
`sage success.sage`


There is also another exercise : 
`sage bank.sage`
